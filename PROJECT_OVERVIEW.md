# Diabetes Risk Prediction Project
## Clear Objectives and Goals | Effective Planning and Timeline

---

## 1. PROBLEM DEFINITION AND FINAL OBJECTIVE

### **The Problematic to Solve:**
Diabetes is a global health crisis affecting over 422 million people worldwide (WHO, 2022). Early detection and risk assessment are crucial for:
- **Preventing complications**: Cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness
- **Reducing healthcare costs**: Early intervention is more cost-effective than treatment
- **Improving quality of life**: Lifestyle modifications can prevent or delay onset
- **Supporting clinical decisions**: Automated screening tools can assist healthcare providers

### **The Challenge:**
Current diabetes screening methods rely heavily on:
- Expensive laboratory tests (HbA1c, fasting glucose)
- Manual risk assessment by healthcare professionals
- Limited accessibility in rural or underserved areas
- Subjective interpretation of risk factors

### **Final Objective:**
**Develop a machine learning-based prediction system that can accurately identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes using easily obtainable health metrics, enabling early intervention and prevention strategies.**

#### **Specific Goals:**
1. **Primary Goal**: Achieve >75% accuracy in diabetes risk prediction
2. **Secondary Goal**: Identify the most important risk factors for diabetes
3. **Tertiary Goal**: Create a deployable web application for real-world use
4. **Impact Goal**: Provide an accessible screening tool for healthcare providers
