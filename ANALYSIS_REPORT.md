# Diabetes Risk Prediction - Analysis Report

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to predict diabetes risk using supervised machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Summary
- **Total Records**: 768 patients
- **Features**: 8 predictive features + 1 target variable
- **Target Distribution**: 
  - No Diabetes: 500 (65.1%)
  - Diabetes: 268 (34.9%)

## Key Findings

### Data Quality
- ‚úÖ No missing values in the dataset
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Zero values present in critical columns (may indicate missing data):
  - Insulin: 374 zeros (48.7%)
  - SkinThickness: 227 zeros (29.6%)
  - BloodPressure: 35 zeros (4.6%)
  - BMI: 11 zeros (1.4%)
  - Glucose: 5 zeros (0.7%)

### Feature Correlations
Key correlations observed:
- Strong positive correlation between Age and Pregnancies
- Moderate correlation between BMI and SkinThickness
- Glucose shows the strongest relationship with diabetes outcome

### Model Performance Comparison
| Model | Accuracy | Performance |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Random Forest** | **75.97%** | **üèÜ Best** |
| SVM | 75.32% | Very Good |
| Decision Tree | 72.73% | Good |
| Logistic Regression | 71.43% | Baseline |

### Feature Importance (Random Forest)
1. **Glucose** (27.6%) - Most important predictor
2. **BMI** (15.95%) - Body mass index
3. **Age** (12.72%) - Patient age
4. **DiabetesPedigreeFunction** (12.67%) - Genetic predisposition
5. **BloodPressure** (8.56%)
6. **Pregnancies** (8.45%)
7. **Insulin** (7.24%)
8. **SkinThickness** (6.80%)

## Model Selection Justification

### Why Random Forest was chosen:
1. **Highest Accuracy**: 75.97% on test set
2. **Robust Performance**: Ensemble method reduces overfitting
3. **Feature Importance**: Provides interpretable feature rankings
4. **Handles Missing Data**: Can work with zero values better than other models
5. **Non-linear Relationships**: Captures complex patterns in the data

### Classification Performance:
- **Precision for No Diabetes**: 79%
- **Recall for No Diabetes**: 85%
- **Precision for Diabetes**: 68%
- **Recall for Diabetes**: 59%

## Recommendations

### For Clinical Use:
1. **Glucose levels** are the most critical indicator - monitor closely
2. **BMI and Age** are significant risk factors
3. Consider **family history** (DiabetesPedigreeFunction) in assessments

### For Model Improvement:
1. Handle zero values in Insulin and SkinThickness more carefully
2. Consider feature engineering (e.g., BMI categories)
3. Collect more data to improve minority class (diabetes) prediction
4. Try ensemble methods or hyperparameter tuning

### For Data Collection:
1. Ensure proper measurement of Insulin and SkinThickness
2. Consider additional features like diet, exercise, etc.
3. Balance the dataset to improve diabetes prediction

## Technical Implementation
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Split**: 80% training, 20% testing
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- **Validation**: Stratified train-test split

## Conclusion
The Random Forest model achieved 75.97% accuracy in predicting diabetes risk, with Glucose being the most important feature. The model shows good performance for identifying non-diabetic patients but could be improved for detecting diabetes cases.
